### Code Style

- Use PEP 8 as a style guide for Python code
- Document new functions and classes with docstrings
- Write meaningful comments for complex code sections
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Tests

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass successfully before creating a pull request
